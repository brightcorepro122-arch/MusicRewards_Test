## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Tech Stack
- **Framework**: React Native with Expo (v54)
- **Navigation**: Custom state-based navigation (bypassed Expo Router for stability)
- **State Management**: Zustand with AsyncStorage persistence
- **Audio Playback**: expo-av (replaced react-native-track-player for Expo Go compatibility)
- **Styling**: StyleSheet with custom theme system
- **Architecture**: Hook-based business logic, store-centric state management

### Key Patterns
- **Component Architecture**: Glass design system with blur effects
- **State Management**: Domain-focused Zustand stores (musicStore, userStore)
- **Business Logic**: Custom hooks orchestrate store actions and async operations
- **UI Components**: Reusable glass components with consistent design tokens
- **Navigation**: Modal-heavy architecture with tab-based navigation

##  Sample Challenges

The app includes 5 sample challenges using SoundHelix music tracks:

1. **Classical Masterpiece** by Beethoven (6:12, 50 points, Easy)
2. **Jazz Vibes** by Miles Davis (5:02, 75 points, Medium)
3. **Electronic Beats** by Deadmau5 (5:44, 100 points, Hard)
4. **Acoustic Serenade** by Ed Sheeran (5:02, 60 points, Easy)
5. **Rock Anthem** by Queen (4:30, 80 points, Medium)

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup Instructions

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd test-app
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

4. **Run on device/simulator**
   ```bash
   # iOS
   npx expo run:ios
   
   # Android
   npx expo run:android
   ```

### Alternative Setup

npx expo start -c

# Reset dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## üéµ Audio Setup

The app uses remote audio URLs from SoundHelix:
- All tracks are streamed directly (no local files required)
- Audio playback works with expo-av integration
- Supports play/pause and progress tracking
- Real-time progress updates every second
- Proper audio cleanup and memory management

## üè™ State Management

### Music Store (`musicStore.ts`)
- Manages challenge data and playback state
- Tracks current track, playing status, and position
- Handles challenge progress and completion
- Persists challenge data to AsyncStorage

### User Store (`userStore.ts`)
- Manages user points and completed challenges
- Tracks total earned points
- Handles challenge completion
- Persists user data to AsyncStorage

### Custom Hooks
- **`useMusicPlayer`**: Audio playback integration with expo-av
- **`usePointsCounter`**: Real-time points tracking during playback
- **Audio Management**: Proper cleanup and state persistence across navigation

### Bonus Stores
- **`achievementsStore`**: Manages 15+ achievements with automatic unlocking
- **`dailyChallengesStore`**: Handles rotating daily challenges and progress
- **`settingsStore`**: User preferences and theme management
- **`userStore`**: Enhanced user data with levels and streaks

## üöÄ Performance Considerations

- **Selectors**: Zustand selectors prevent unnecessary re-renders
- **Audio Management**: Proper cleanup and memory management
- **State Persistence**: Efficient AsyncStorage integration
- **Navigation**: Lightweight state-based navigation
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup in useEffect hooks
- **Audio Cleanup**: Prevents memory leaks with proper audio unloading
