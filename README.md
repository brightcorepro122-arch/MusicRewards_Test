# Reset dependencies
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

## üéµ Audio Setup

The app uses remote audio URLs from SoundHelix:
- All tracks are streamed directly (no local files required)
- Audio playback works with expo-av integration
- Supports play/pause and progress tracking
- Real-time progress updates every second
- Proper audio cleanup and memory management

## üè™ State Management

### Music Store (`musicStore.ts`)
- Manages challenge data and playback state
- Tracks current track, playing status, and position
- Handles challenge progress and completion
- Persists challenge data to AsyncStorage

### User Store (`userStore.ts`)
- Manages user points and completed challenges
- Tracks total earned points
- Handles challenge completion
- Persists user data to AsyncStorage

### Custom Hooks
- **`useMusicPlayer`**: Audio playback integration with expo-av
- **`usePointsCounter`**: Real-time points tracking during playback
- **Audio Management**: Proper cleanup and state persistence across navigation

## üé® Design System

### Theme System
- **Colors**: Modern dark theme with purple accents
- **Typography**: System fonts with consistent sizing
- **Spacing**: 8px grid system with consistent margins/padding
- **Border Radius**: Consistent rounded corners throughout
- **Clean UI**: Minimal, modern interface focused on functionality
