## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What if I can't complete all features in 5 hours?**
A: Focus on quality over quantity. A well-implemented subset is better than a broken complete app.

**Q: Can I use additional libraries?**
A: Stick to the specified dependencies unless you have a good reason and document it.

**Q: What about testing?**
A: Not required for this assessment, but feel free to add tests if time permits.

**Q: iOS vs Android - which should I prioritize?**
A: Both if possible, but iOS simulator is usually easier to set up and record.
